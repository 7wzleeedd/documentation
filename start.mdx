Follow these steps to start using blaze in your server \<3

**Step 1**: Set blaze admins

```shellscript
!set admin (userid)
```

**Step 2**: Set antiraid/antinuke admins.

```shellscript
!set antinuke admin (userid)

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. To run Mintlify on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```
